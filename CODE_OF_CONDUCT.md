# Code of Conduct at LabDAO

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, collaborative, and welcoming environment, we pledge to making participation in our LabDAO projects and community a welcoming experience for everyone.

## We care üòä

nf-core's CoC and expectations of respectful behaviours for all participants (including organisers and the nf-core team) include but are not limited to the following (listed in alphabetical order):

- Ask for consent before sharing another community member‚Äôs personal information (including photographs) on social media.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.
- Celebrate your accomplishments at events! (Get creative with your use of emojis üéâ ü•≥ üíØ üôå !)
- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)
- Graciously accept constructive criticism, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.
- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We‚Äôve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we‚Äôre interested in getting to know you and your visions for open tools!)
- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don‚Äôt see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communications to be kind.**)
- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.

## We frown on üòï

The following behaviours from any participants within the nf-core community (including the organisers) will be considered unacceptable under this code of conduct. Engaging or advocating for any of the following could result in expulsion from nf-core workspaces.

- ‚ÄúDoxing‚Äù i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person‚Äôs personal identifying information online.
- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.
- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Procedures for Reporting CoC violations

If someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible. You can reach out to members of the [LabDAO core team](https://discord.gg/labdao) and they will forward your concerns. Issues directly concerning members of the core team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account.

All reports will be handled with utmost discretion and confidentially.
